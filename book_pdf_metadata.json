Over the \nyears, I have seen many people struggle with managing their budgets, and I \nwanted to create a resource that would make this process easier and more \naccessible. \nMy journey with Excel began many years ago when I first started teaching \ncomputer classes in Melbourne, Australia. Since then, I have had the \nprivilege of working with various organizations, including the Royal \nAgricultural Society (RAS), New South Wales Police Force, the Royal \nAustralian Air Force (RAAF), Transport NSW, and Grosvenor Engineering. \nThese experiences have given me a deep understanding of the practical \napplications of Excel and the challenges people face when using it. \nThis book is designed to guide you through the process of creating a \ncomprehensive home budget using Excel. Whether you are a complete \nbeginner or have some experience with spreadsheets, you will find \nvaluable tips and techniques to help you manage your finances more \neffectively. \nI hope you find this book helpful and that it empowers you to take control \nof your financial future.

It offers a wide \nrange of features, including the ability to perform calculations and data analysis, \ncreate charts and graphs, and automate tasks through the use of macros. Excel is \nwidely used in businesses, finances, and other industries for tasks such as \nbudgeting, data analysis, and record-keeping. This course will guide you in \nlearning how to use Excel to create a Home Budget Spreadsheet and also help you \nto gain skills to create and modify other spreadsheets as well. \nWhat is a spreadsheet? \nUnderstanding the history of spreadsheets provides insight into their evolution \nand why Excel remains a powerful and versatile tool today. \nA quick history of spreadsheets \nThe first electronic spreadsheet, VisiCalc, was released in 1979 for the Apple II \ncomputer. \nIt was developed by Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston, and its popularity helped \nestablish personal computers as essential business tools. \nIn the early 1980s, Lotus 1-2-3 became the industry standard for spreadsheets, \nespecially during the rise of IBM PCs. \nThen in 1985, Microsoft Excel was launched for Macintosh, and later in 1987 for \nWindows — eventually becoming the most widely used spreadsheet software \ntoday. \nOver time, spreadsheets evolved with new features like charting, data analysis, \nand macro programming, making them an essential tool in almost every industry \ntoday."

More importantly, users can program these cells as \nthey see fit and create bespoke applications. For example, businesses can create \nbespoke invoice systems or project trackers using spreadsheet functionalities.. \nThese abilities have made spreadsheets a powerful tool for business and personal \nuse alike. Having skills in programming spreadsheets can put you at the forefront \nfor prospective employers. \nKey Points: \n1. VisiCalc: First electronic spreadsheet, released in 1979, developed by Dan \nBricklin and Bob Frankston. \n2. Lotus 1-2-3: Released in 1983, became the industry standard in the 1980s. \n3.

Modern Features: Sophistication increased in the 1990s and 2000s with \ngraphing, data analysis, and macro programming. \n5. Versatility: Unique capability to place data in cells, perform calculations, \nand create bespoke applications. \nLayout of the spreadsheet page \nThe layout of a spreadsheet page consists of rows and columns.  \n• \nAt the top of the Excel window, you will find the menu bar and the \nribbon. The menu bar contains tabs like File, Home, Insert, and others. \nWhen you select one of these tabs, the ribbon below it displays a set of \nrelated buttons and commands. The ribbon is the primary interface for \naccessing the tools and features used to perform various tasks in Excel, \nsuch as formatting, data manipulation, inserting charts, and applying \nformulas."

It is the entire document that you save with the .xlsx \nextension (or another format compatible with Excel). Think of a workbook \nlike a book containing multiple pages, where each page is a worksheet. \n• \nWorksheet: A worksheet is a single \"page\" within a workbook. It consists \nof a grid of rows and columns where data is entered and manipulated. In \nExcel, worksheets are accessed via tabs at the bottom of the workbook \nwindow. Each tab represents one worksheet. A single workbook can \ncontain multiple worksheets. \n• \nSpreadsheet: This term is often used interchangeably with \"worksheet,\" \nthough it can also refer more broadly to the type of application (like Excel \nitself).

When this formula \nis copied to another cell, the references will not change. \n• \nMixed Reference  \no Example: =A$1+$B1 \nIn this formula, A$1 is a mixed reference with an absolute row and \nrelative column, while $B1 has an absolute column and relative \nrow.  \nWhen copied, only the relative parts will adjust. \n \nNested Formula \nAn Excel formula with more than one formula within it is called a nested formula. \nThis means it contains multiple functions or operations that are combined to \nproduce a single result. Below are samples of two nested formulas, similar to what \nwe will be using later."

    "text": "45 \n \nMastering Excel for Home Budgeting \nArithmetic Nested Formula  \nArithmetic Nested Formula will use two or more distinct formulas to calculate a \nsingle value. The formula below involves nested arithmetic operations and \nfunctions within the parenthesis. It uses the SUM function nested within a \nmultiplication operation \n=D5*(SUM(B2:B6) + (D2*D3)), the SUM function and the multiplication operation \nwithin parentheses are nested within the overall formula. Excel will use the \nPEMDAS order of operations when calculating the formulas \n=D5*(SUM(B2:B6) + (D2*D3)) step by step to understand how it works: \n1. Inner Calculations: \no \nSUM(B2:B6): This part of the formula calculates the sum of the \nvalues in cells B2 to B6. \no \n(D2*D3): This part multiplies the value in cell D3 by D2 (total kids \npocket money). \n2. Combining the Inner Results: (for the outer brackets) \no \nThe results of SUM(B2:B6) and (D3*D2) are then added together. \nSo,  \nif SUM(B2:B6) returns 15  \nand (D3*D2) returns 10,  \nthe combined result will be 25. \n3. Multiplication with D2: \no \nFinally, the combined result from the addition (in our example, \n25) is multiplied by the value in cell D5. So, if D5 contains the \nvalue 4 (quarterly), the final calculation will be 4 * 25, which \nequals 100. \nSummary: The formula =D5*(SUM(B2:B6) + (D2*D3)) performs the following \nsteps: \n1. Inner Parenthesis: Sums the monthly expenses values in the range B2:B6 \nusing the SUM(B2:B6) function. \n2. Inner Parenthesis: Multiplies the value in cell D3 by D2 to calculate the \ntotal kids pocket money for the month."

    "text": "71 \n \nMastering Excel for Home Budgeting \nWS 1 – Lookup Tables \nIntroduction \nWelcome to WS1 – Lookup Tables! Before we dive into creating specific \nworksheets for your budgeting application, we need to set up a foundational \ncomponent that will make the entire process smoother and more efficient. The \nLookups worksheet will house essential data tables and named ranges that we will \nuse throughout the workbook. These lookup tables will enable us to automate \ndata retrieval, ensure consistency, and reduce manual entry errors as we build \nand work with various worksheets. \nTip: While you can’t see Named Ranges on paper, they’re an important part of many \nformulas — they make your spreadsheets easier to build and read. You’ll see them \nused throughout this example. \nIn this section, you will learn how to: \n• \nCreate a dedicated Lookup Tables worksheet. \n• \nSet up various lookup tables that will be referenced in subsequent \nworksheets. \n• \nDefine named ranges for easy and efficient data management. \nBy setting up the Lookups worksheet first, you will establish a robust framework \nthat supports all other aspects of your budgeting application. This preparation will \nstreamline the process of creating and using formulas, making your workbook \nmore dynamic and user-friendly. \nTip for LibreOffice Users \nSetting up lookup tables works the same way in LibreOffice Calc. \nTo define a data range for lookup purposes, use Data → Define Range. \nThis allows you to manage named data blocks similar to how Excel manages table \nareas. \n \nKey Benefits \n1. Automation: Lookups enable Excel to automatically retrieve relevant \ndata, minimizing the need for repetitive manual inputs or locking values \ninto formula."

Efficiency: With lookups in place, you can quickly and easily reference \nimportant data, saving time and reducing errors. \n4. Ease of Changing and Personalizing Data: When you need to update or \npersonalize data, you can simply modify the lookup tables in one place. \nThis change will automatically reflect across all related worksheets, \nmaking the process seamless and efficient. \nThis is what the Lookups Table worksheet will look like when completed. Please \nnote that the details in these lookups are for Australia, we will discuss later how to \nchange this for your location at the end of the course. Stay with these values until \nthen so you check the results when using them as we work through the course. \n \nNOTE: Throughout this course, you will see cell ranges referred to like this \"A1:B5\",  \nfor two or more adjacent cells, \"A1:A2\" or span rows and columns. In Excel, \"A1:B5\" \nrefers to a range of cells that starts from cell A1 and extends to cell B5. This range \nincludes all the cells in the rectangular area bounded by these two cells, specifically \ncells A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, B1, B2, B3, B4, and B5. The notation \"A1:B5\" is used to \nreference this group of cells in formulas, functions, and other Excel operations, \nallowing users to perform calculations or apply formatting to multiple cells \nsimultaneously.  \n \nLet us get started by creating the Lookups worksheet and setting up the necessary \ntables and named ranges that will be essential for the rest of our workbook."

This formula subtracts the \nDepart Date from the Return Date to give the total days you will be away. \nNote that when you subtract one date from another, the result is in days \n \n• \nG7  \nThe formula is =((D7-7)-C7)/7 and is used to calculate the number of weeks \nbetween two dates, with a specific adjustment to the end date. Here is a \nstep-by-step explanation of what the formula does: \no Subtraction of 7 from D7: \n▪ \nD7 contains the Depart Date. \n▪ \nBy subtracting 7 (D7-7), the formula adjusts the end date \nback by one week. This ensures the amount will be saved \nbefore the depart date. You can adjust this if required, i.e. \n(D7-28) will give an end saving date 4 weeks before Depart \nDate. \no Subtraction of C7 from the Adjusted D7: \n▪ \nC7 contains the start date. \n▪ \nThe formula then subtracts the start date (C7) from the \nadjusted end date (D7-7). This gives the total number of \ndays between the start date and the adjusted end date. \no Division by 7: \n▪ \nThe result from the previous step (total number of days) is \ndivided by 7 to convert the days into weeks. \nSo, the formula =((D7-7)-C7)/7 calculates the number of weeks between the \nstart date in C7 and the adjusted end date in D7 (which is shifted back by \none week)."

Where there are differences, specific \nguidance will be provided for each platform. \n \nVBA (Visual Basic for Applications) Macros are scripts written in the VBA \nprogramming language that automate tasks in Microsoft Office applications, such \nas Excel. Macros can perform repetitive actions quickly, streamline complex \nworkflows, and enhance the functionality of Excel worksheets by allowing users to \ncreate custom commands and functions. \nPlease note that this is not meant to be a comprehensive course in macro \ndevelopment. As rich as Excel is in functions, you may need specialized functions that \nExcel does not provide. You can create these functions yourself using macros to meet \nyour specific needs.

This includes the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor, \nwhere you can write and modify VBA code, and the ability to add form controls \nlike buttons and text boxes to your worksheets. Enabling the Developer tab in \nExcel unlocks these powerful features, allowing you to customize your Excel \nenvironment and automate tasks. We will enable them shortly. \nTip for LibreOffice Users \nLibreOffice Calc does not use a Developer tab like Excel. \nTo access macro-related tools in LibreOffice, go to Tools → Macros on the top menu. \nFrom there, you can manage, create, and edit macros without needing to customize \nthe toolbar. \n \nWhat is a Function \nA Function in VBA is a block of code that performs a specific task and returns a \nvalue. Functions are used to execute calculations, manipulate data, or perform \noperations that can be reused throughout your VBA code. They can accept inputs, \nknown as arguments, and use these inputs to generate and return a result."

Subroutines are used to execute actions, such as \nmodifying worksheet data, displaying messages, or interacting with other Excel \nfeatures. Unlike functions, subroutines cannot be used in worksheet formulas, but \nthey can be called from functions. \nWhat is a Macro \nA Macro in VBA is a recorded or written sequence of commands and actions that \nautomate tasks in Excel. Macros can include both functions and subroutines, \nallowing for complex workflows and repetitive processes to be executed with a \nsingle command. Macros can be triggered manually by the user, assigned to a \nbutton, or set to run automatically based on certain events in the workbook. \nNote: When a cell or named range is referenced directly in a VBA macro, it is not \nautomatically adjusted in the VBA code if the cell or range is moved or renamed. This \ncan lead to errors or unexpected results in your macro if the referenced cells or ranges \nare modified. Unlike Excel formulas, which update automatically when cell references \nchange, VBA code requires manual updates to reflect any changes in cell coordinates \nor named ranges. Therefore, it is essential to keep your VBA code in sync with any \nstructural changes in your worksheets to ensure your macros continue to function \ncorrectly.

This budget is no exception. As you use it, you may \nneed to add rows, introduce new features, or make other adjustments. This \nsection will guide you through some basic tasks such as copying cells or \nworksheets, inserting or deleting rows, and more. We will also highlight important \nconsiderations for each task to ensure you make these changes effectively. \nWhat do we mean by dynamic? \nExcel’s intelligent referencing system is a key feature that ensures calculations \nremain accurate and up to date when changes are made. This system \nautomatically updates formulas and references whenever cells, rows, or columns \nare moved, added, or deleted. For instance, if you insert a new row within a range \nof data, Excel adjusts the cell references in your formulas to account for the new \nrow, maintaining the integrity of your calculations. This dynamic updating \ncapability is essential for keeping your workbook functional and dependable, \nallowing you to adjust as needed without having to manually modify all related \nformulas. \nWhile Excel’s intelligent referencing system is powerful and will perform flawlessly \nfor you, there are certain limitations to be aware of when modifying your \nworkbook.  \n• \nExcel will not automatically update formulas or references embedded \nwithin VBA code, so any changes to cell locations or worksheet names \nembedded in the VBA code or macro must be manually updated in your \nmacros. Additionally  \n• \nExcel does not adjust references in text strings or comments, so these \nmust also be revised manually if they contain cell references that have \nchanged."

Backup Your Workbook: Always create a backup of your workbook before \nstarting any modifications. \n2. Ensure Rule One is Obeyed: Verify that you have made a backup. \nTake a moment to consider the implications if something were to go wrong during \nyour modifications and your workbook becomes unusable. By following these \nrules, you can safeguard your work and ensure that any potential issues can be \nquickly resolved or reversed. With these precautions in place and a backup made, \nlet us proceed with the modifications.  \nNote on Terminology \nIn the following sections, we will frequently refer to Rows, Columns, Cells, and Ranges. \nWhile each of these elements has its specific function within an Excel worksheet, their \nbehavior is quite similar when it comes to operations like inserting, moving, copying, \nand deleting. Whether you are working with a single cell, a full row, a column, or a \ndefined range of cells, the methods and considerations for modifying them often \noverlap.

We \nused this approach to give you some hands-on experience using VBA or \nLibreBASIC code, which is an important part of this workbook—and a valuable skill \nto have. \nThat method worked well, and we could leave it at that. However, there are two \nadditional pay periods in the Income work area that weren’t included in the \noriginal dropdown — and we’d like to add them in. \nTo make the system more flexible and easier to maintain, we’ll now revise the \noriginal setup. We’ll start by updating the named range used for the dropdown, \nand then gradually move away from the VBA macro approach. Instead, we’ll use a \nVLOOKUP-based method driven by a lookup table — making it easier to modify or \nexpand in the future without needing to touch any code. \n• \nFor Excel users, we’ll begin by adjusting the named range and dropdown \nsetup, then transition to a VLOOKUP-based approach. \n• \nFor LibreOffice users, since Calc doesn’t support using named ranges in \ndropdowns the same way, we’ll take a slightly different route — still using \nVLOOKUP, but adapted to LibreOffice’s capabilities. \nHere’s how we’ll do it. \nThe changes to the dropdown are minimal.

Here are the primary reasons \nwhy you should consider protecting your Excel workbook: \n• \nData Integrity: To prevent unintentional changes, deletions, or errors that \ncould distort the data and lead to inaccurate results or conclusions. \n• \nConfidentiality: If the workbook contains confidential or proprietary \ninformation, it is essential to restrict unauthorized access. \n• \nPrevent Misuse: Protecting a workbook can prevent others from \nexploiting or misusing the information for purposes other than that for \nwhich it was intended."

Protecting these cells \nensures these formulas are not accidentally deleted or modified. \n• \nProtection from Malicious Intent: Theres always a risk of someone \nintentionally trying to alter or corrupt the data, especially in shared or \nnetworked environments. \n• \nStructural Consistency: Prevents others from adding, deleting, hiding, or \nrenaming worksheets, thus maintaining the workbook's structure. \n• \nCustomization: Excel's protection features allow for a customized level of \nsecurity, from protecting individual cells to entire worksheets or the \nworkbook structure. \n• \nFeedback Control: If you are sending out a workbook for feedback, \nprotection can ensure that reviewers only comment or suggest in \ndesignated areas rather than change the original content. \n• \nMaintain Macros: If you have embedded macros in your workbook for \nautomation, protection ensures they cannot be viewed or modified, \nmaintaining their functionality. \n• \nLicense and Copyright Protection: For creators who sell Excel templates \nor tools, protection ensures that intellectual property remains secure, and \nothers cannot easily replicate or distribute the tool without permission. \nIn summary, protecting an Excel workbook ensures the safety, integrity, and \nconfidentiality of your data. Given the multiple layers and types of protection \nExcel offers (from basic cell protection to encrypting with a password), you can \ntailor protection to fit their specific needs. \nLet us get started."
